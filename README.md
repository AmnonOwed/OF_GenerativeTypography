Generative Typography
=====================

This is an OpenFrameworks port of the CAN_GenerativeTypography examples, originally written in Processing.
I am doing this port purely for learning purposes, so it may contain incorrect, inefficient or incomplete code.
It's a work-in-progress, which may or may not be fully completed. You can follow / see the progress in the list below.

The original blog post can be found [here](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/generative-typography-processing-tutorial).

The original Processing code repository can be found [here ](https://github.com/AmnonOwed/CAN_GenerativeTypography).

All code examples ported by [Amnon Owed](http://vimeo.com/amnon) / [@AmnonOwed](https://twitter.com/AmnonOwed) with [OpenFrameworks 0.8.4.](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)
